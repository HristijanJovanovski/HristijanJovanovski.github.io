    <h4>-About me-</h4>
    <p>  <img src="polaroid.png" height="2160" width="1620"/>Hello there! My name is Christian Jovanovski, but you can call me Chris. I come from the beautiful city of Kumanovo in North Macedonia. Currently, I am a student at the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering, where I have recently completed my first year.

        As a passionate learner in the field of computer science, I find immense joy in exploring the vast world of technology and its applications. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a solid foundation in various programming languages and gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of computer systems.

        While my educational focus lies in computer science, I have a deep interest in economics as well. In the future, I aspire to pursue a master's degree in economics to broaden my knowledge and gain a holistic perspective on the intersection of technology and business. With this knowledge, I hope to embark on an entrepreneurial journey and establish my own business.

        Aside from academics and future aspirations, I am an individual who appreciates the value of personal connections and friendships. My friends often refer to me as Chris, and I enjoy spending quality time with them, engaging in meaningful conversations, and creating memorable experiences.</p>
